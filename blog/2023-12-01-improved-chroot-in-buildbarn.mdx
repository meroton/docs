# Improved chroot in Buildbarn

We have just started a documentation series
describing the Buildbarn `chroot` runners,
and how they can be used for hermetic input roots
that contain all the required tools.
This includes implementation notes for a "mountat" functionality
created through the new Linux mount API,
how you can use this under-documented API
and its shortcomings.
And how this _can/will be_ integrated into Buildbarn,
with technical descriptions of the workers and runners.

The first sections are already available, with more to come!

Sections:

* [Use chroot in Buildbarn]
* [Implement mountat with the new mount API]
* [Unmount from relative file paths and directory file descriptors]
