title: Updates to Buildbarn deployment repo as of Febuary 2023

The example configuration project for buildbarn
[bb-deployments](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-deployments)
has gotten updates.

This is a continuation of the
[updates from last year article](/blog/bb-deploy-updates-2022-04)
and is a high level summary of what has happened since April 2022 up to 2023-02-16.

## Let ReferenceExpandingBlobAccess support GCS

ReferenceExpandingBlobAccess already supports S3 so support was extended to Google Cloud Storage buckets.

## Support for prefetching Virtual Filesystems

Running workers with Fuse allows inputs for an action
to be downloaded on demand.
This significantly reduces the amount of data
that gets sent in order to run overspecified actions.
This however leads to poor performance for actions
which reads a lot of their inputs synchronously.

With the prefetcher most of these actions can be recognized
and data which is likely to be needed
can be downloaded ahead of time.

## Support for sha256tree

Buildbarn has added support for sha256tree
which uses sha256 hashing over a tree structure similar to blake3.

This algorithm will allow large CAS objects to be chunked and decompositioned
with guaranteed data integrity while still using sha256 hardware instructions.

## Completeness checking now streams REv2 Tree objects

This change introduces a small change to the configuration schema. If you previous had this:
```
backend: { completenessChecking: ... },
```
You will now need to write something along these lines:
```
backend: {
    completenessChecking: {
        backend: ...,
        maximumTotalTreeSizeBytes: 64 * 1024 * 1024,
    },
},
```

[bb-storage commit 1b84fa8](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-storage/commit/1b84fa824dc60e77776ce50e05c549fdf20c089b).

## Postponed healthy service status

The healthy and serving status,
i.e. HTTP `/-/healthy` and
[grpc_health_v1.HealthCheckResponse_SERVING](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/health/grpc_health_v1#HealthCheckResponse_ServingStatus),
are now postponed until the whole service is up and running.
Before, the healthy status was potentially reported before starting to listen to the gRPC ports.
Kubernetes will now wait until the service is up before forwarding connections to it.

## Server keepalive parameter options

The option `buildbarn.configuration.grpc.ServerConfiguration.keepalive_parameters` can be used for L4 load balancing,
to control when to ask clients to reconnect.
For default values, see
[keepalive.ServerParameters](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc@v1.49.0/keepalive#ServerParameters).

## Graceful termination of `LocalBlobAccess`

When `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` is received, the `LocalBlobAccess` now synchronize data to disk before shutting down.
Deployments using persistent storage will no longer observe loss of data when restarting the `bb_storage` services.

## Non-sector Aligned Writes to Block Device

Using sector aligned storage is wasteful for the action cache where the messages are typically very small.
Buildbarn can now fill all the gaps when writing, making storage more efficient.

## DAG Shaped BlobAccess Configuration

Instead of a tree shaped BlobAccess configuration, the `with_labels` notation allows a directed acyclic graph.
See also the
[bb-storage commit cc295ad](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-storage/commit/cc295adc0f05cd579d48a65325ce54b54331c6a6).

## NFSv4 as worker filesystem

The `bb_worker` can now supply the working directory for `bb_runner` using NFSv4.
Previously, FUSE and hard linking files from the worker cache were the only two options.
This addition was mainly done to overcome the poor FUSE support on macOS.

The NFSv4 server in `bb_worker` only supports macOS at the moment.
No effort has been spent to write custom mount logic for other systems yet.

## Specify `forwardMetadata` with a JMESPath

Metadata forwarding is now more flexible, the JMESPath expressions can for example add authorization result data.
The format is described in
[grpc.proto](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-storage/blob/0c2fcad5872b0fef47bb5bee8aba9518dc2fe465/pkg/proto/configuration/grpc/grpc.proto#L55-L93).

A common use case is to replace
```jsonnet
{
    forwardMetadata: ["build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.requestmetadata-bin"],
}
```
with
```jsonnet
{
    addMetadataJmespathExpression: '{
        "build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.requestmetadata-bin":
            incomingGRPCMetadata."build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.requestmetadata-bin"
    }',
}
```

## Tracing: Deprecate the Jaeger collector span exporter

This option is deprecated, as Jaeger 1.35 and later provide native support for the OpenTelemetry protocol.

## `bb-deployments` Ubuntu 22.04 Example Runner Image

The [rbe_autoconfig](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-toolchains/blob/4.0.0/rules/rbe_repo.bzl#L896)
in [bazel-toolchains](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-toolchains)
has been deprecated. In bb-deployments it has been replaced by the
[Act](https://github.com/nektos/act/blob/master/IMAGES.md) image
[ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:act-22.04](https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images),
distributed by [catthehacker](https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images),
used for running GitHub Actions locally under Ubuntu 22.04.

## `bb-deployments` Integration Tests

The [bare deployment](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-deployments/tree/ce123473f27290648d1e56f7072468eb6b67fefb/bare) and
[Docker Compose deployment](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-deployments/tree/ce123473f27290648d1e56f7072468eb6b67fefb/docker-compose)
have now got [tests scripts](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-deployments/tree/ce123473f27290648d1e56f7072468eb6b67fefb/tools)
that builds and tests `@abseil-hello//:hello_test` remotely, shuts down and then checks for 100% cache hit after restart.
Another CI test is checking for minimal differences between the Docker Compose deployment and
the [Kubernetes deployment](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-deployments/tree/ce123473f27290648d1e56f7072468eb6b67fefb/kubernetes).
