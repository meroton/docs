# Free tier updates

We've performed some updates to the free tier and our pricing model.

## Shared Cache

The free tier has been upgraded into an environment with a 1TB cache.
This means that you can use the free tier without worrying about hitting any limits or setup process.

Do note that while the cached items will only be accessible with the correct api keys,
the storage area can be reclaimed by anyone.
I.e. as the cache becomes full your items might be dropped.

With the current churn we expect any items in the cache last at least a week.
However, you should always treat items in the cache as something which might be dropped at any moment.
The purpose and design of the cache is to maximize build performance, not to provide storage.

## Shared executors

New for the free environment is the introduction of remote execution,
this was previously only available for paying customers.

If you're using bazel you can simply add the `--remote_executor=<...>` flag and your builds will be done remotely.

The free environment has access to 64 shared executors.

## Starter tier

If you need dedicated storage for evaluation purposes we also offer a starter tier.
The starter tier is a streamlined environment with 100 GB of dedicated cache and access to the same 64 executors as the free tier.

This allows you to try out remote execution and caching without being disturbed by others.
While the 100GB dedicated cache will only be used by you and therefore not be overwritten by anyone else's build,
the cache is still a cache and the system will still drop the cache entries if it determines it is useful for maximizing performance.

## Need more executors?

At the moment the starter tier has a fixed amount of shared executors.
If you need a scalable solution contact us for setting up a custom Buildbarn environment of any size.
