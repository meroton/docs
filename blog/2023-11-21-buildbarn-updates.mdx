This is a continuation of the
[previous update article](/blog/bb-deployments-updates-2023-02)
and is a high level summary of what has happened in Buildbarn from 2023-02-16 to 2023-11-14.

## Added support for JWTs signed with RSA

Support for JWTs signed with RSA has been added.
The following JWT signing algorithms are now supported:

- HS256
- HS384
- HS512
- RS256
- RS384
- RS512
- EdDSA
- ES256
- ES384
- ES512

## Generalized tuneables for Linux BDI options

Linux 6.2 added a sysfs attribute for toggling `BDI_CAP_STRICTLIMIT` on FUSE mounts.
If using the FUSE backed virtual file system on Linux 6.2
adding `{ "strict_limit": "0" }` to `linux_backing_dev_info_tunables`
will remove the `BDI_CAP_STRICTLIMIT` flag from the FUSE mount.

This may improve fileystem performance
especially when running build actions which
uses mmap:ed files extensively.

## Add support for injecting Xcode environment variables

Remote build with macOS may call into locally installed copies of Xcode.
The path to the local copy of Xcode may vary
and Bazel assumes that the remote execution service
is capable of processing Xcode specific environment variables.

See the [proto files](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-remote-execution/blob/master/pkg/proto/configuration/bb_runner/bb_runner.proto#L133) for details.

## Add a minimum timestamp to ActionResultExpiringBlobAccess

A misbehaving worker may polluted the action cache,
after fixing the misbehaving worker
we would rather not throw away the entire action cache.

A minimum timestamp in ActionResultExpiringBlobAccess
allows us to mark a timestamp in the past
before which the action should be considered invalid.

## Add authentication to HTTP servers

Much like the gRPC servers are capable of authenticated configuration
the http servers can now also require authentication.

This allows the bb_browser and bb_scheduler UI
to authenticate access using OAuth2 without involving any other middleware.

This also allows us to add authorization configuration for administrative tasks
such as draining workers or killing of jobs.

## Authentication using a JSON Web Key Set

JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) is a standard format
which allows us to specificy multiple different encryption keys
that may have been used to sign our JWT authentication.

Buildbarn can load the JWKS specification,
either inline or as a file,
when specifying trusted encryption keys.

This allows us to have rotation with overlap of encryption keys.
