## Unlock the Power of Buildbarn with Expert Guidance

**Buildbarn Fundamentals** is more than just a training session; it’s an
opportunity to set up a production-ready Buildbarn reference cluster in your own
AWS environment. By participating in the course, your team will not only
understand what makes Buildbarn tick but also walk away with a fully functional
Remote Build Environment (RBE) cluster, which you can continue to use or adapt
to your organization’s needs.

At Meroton, we believe that mastering the management of remote build
environments is crucial for modern development workflows. This course is
designed to be both comprehensive and practical, offering a deep dive into
Buildbarn while equipping your team with the operational knowledge to
effectively maintain and scale your infrastructure.

## What You'll Learn

Buildbarn Fundamentals is a hands-on course that teaches participants how to:

- Set up a fully operational Buildbarn cluster in AWS
- Manage and operate Buildbarn clusters independently
- Integrate third-party tools to enhance your build environment and understand
  the needs of consumers

By the end of the course, your team will have the skills and confidence to
