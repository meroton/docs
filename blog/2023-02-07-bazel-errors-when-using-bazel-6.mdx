title: Bazel 6 Errors when using Build without the Bytes

Starting from v6.0.0, Bazel crashes when building without the bytes.
Because it sets `--experimental_action_cache_store_output_metadata`
when using `--remote_download_minimal` or `--remote_download_toplevel`.

Effectively this leads to Bazel getting stuck in a build failure loop
when your remote cache evicts an item you need from the cache.

```console
developer@machine:~$ bazel test @abseil-hello//:hello_test --remote_download_
minimal

```

The key here is **(Exit 34): xx errors during bulk transfer**.
34 is Bazel's error code for Remote Error.

The recommended solution is to set the flag explicitly to false,
with `--experimental_action_cache_store_output_metadata=false`.
To quickly solve the issue on your local machine you can run `bazel clean`.
However, this will just push the error into the future.

The bug is independent of which remote cache system you use
and is tracked at [GitHub](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17366).

## Background

When performing an analysis of what to build
Bazel will ask the remote cache which items have already been built.
Bazel will only schedule build actions for items
that do not already exist in the cache.
If running a build without the bytes[^1]
the intermediary results will not be downloaded to the client.

Should the cached items be evicted
then Bazel will run into an unrecoverable error.
It wants the remote system to perform an action using inputs from the cache,
but they have disappeared.
And Bazel can not upload them,
as they were never downloaded to the client.
The build would then dutifully crash
(some work has been put into trying to
[resolve this on the bazel side](https://groups.google.com/g/bazel-dev/c/WwNN4kiYSpc)
but it has not been considered a priority).

This puts an implicit requirement on the remote cache implementation.
Artifacts need to be saved for as long as Bazel needs them.
The problem here is that this is an undefined period of time.
Bazel will not proactively check if the item still exists,
nor in any other manner inform the cache that
it will need the item in the future.

## Before v6.0.0

Bazel tied the lifetime of which items already exists in the cache
(the existence cache)
to the analysis cache.
Whenever the analysis cache was purged it would also drop the existence cache.

The analysis cache is purged quite frequently.
It would therefore be rare in practice,
that the existence cache would be out of date.
Furthermore, since the existence cache was an in-memory cache,
Bazel crashing would forcefully evict the existence cache.
Thereby fixing the issue.

## After v6.0.0

With the
`--experimental_action_cache_store_output_metadata` flag enabled by default
the existence cache is instead committed to disk and
never dropped during normal operation.

This means two things:

1. The implied requirement on the remote cache is effectively infinite. 
2. Should this requirement not be met the build will fail.
And since the existence cache is committed to disk Bazel will just
fail again the next time you run it.

Currently the only user-facing way of purging the existence cache
is to run `bazel clean`.
Which is generally considered an anti-pattern.

If you are using the [bb-clientd](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-clientd#-to-perform-remote-builds-without-the-bytes) `--remote_output_service`
to run builds without the bytes
(an alternative strategy to `--remote_download_minimal`)
this will not affect you.

[^1]: When using Bazel with remote execution
remote builds are run in a remote server cluster.
There is therefore no need for each developer
to download the partial results of build.
Bazel calls this feature
[Remote Builds Without the Bytes](https://blog.bazel.build/2019/05/07/builds-without-bytes.html).
The progress of the feature can be tracked at
[GitHub](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6862).
