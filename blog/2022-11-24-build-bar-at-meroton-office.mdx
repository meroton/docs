# BuildBar at the Meroton Office

After BazelCon we've all gotten a bit giddy and you might feel excited how the information presented at BazelCon might impact your development workflow.
For that purpose we're inviting everyone in the wider bazel community to an open BuildBar at the Meroton offices.

Come over and digest BazelCon with high level technical discussions of the talks,
great company, a pleasant atmosphere and also beer.

Feel welcome to come over this Thursday the first of December from 16 to 20.

## Directions

You'll find us at our Linköping offices at Fridtunagatan 33. Currently there is some construction but follow the red lines and you'll be fine.
