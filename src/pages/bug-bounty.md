# Meroton Bug Bounty and Vulnerability Disclosure Program

We strive to have world class security with multiple layers of protection ensuring customer data is safe.

If you believe you have found a security issue in a Meroton product or service,
please report it directly to us at security@meroton.com.

We review all submissions and allow bounty rewards of up to USD 10 000
or an equivalent donation to a charity of your choice.

To be eligible for a reward please submit a detailed report with reproducible steps.

We do not accept submissions for ddos attacks or attacks which require root access.

Good faith efforts at preventing service degradation,
user data loss and privacy violations
are indemnified from legal action from Meroton as part of this program.
