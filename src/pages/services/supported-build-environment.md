# Supported Build Environment

[‚Üê Other services](..)

For use cases where you would rather manage your own server cluster
Meroton is available to help you set it up. With the supported build
environment offering your team manages the day-to-day operations while
having access to expert resources which will help you achieve success in
your remote execution journey.

If a self hosted solution doesn't feel like a good fit for you, perhaps
you would rather have [managed buildbarn](../managed-buildbarn).

## Engagement Model

This is an engagement where Merotons engineers meet you where you are.
Merotons engineers will connect with you over a dedicated communication
channel where your team can contact meroton for any services.

Please contact sales@meroton.com for any inquiries.
