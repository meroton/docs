# Managed Buildbarn

[‚Üê Other services](..)

Managing your own Buildbarn environment correctly and performantly is a
difficult task. At Meroton we offer to fully manage a
[Buildbarn](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-deployments) environment for
you with no scaling limits. Allowing you to focus on writing your code
while we handle the system.

If you feel like you would rather manage the environment yourself please
read more about [supported build
environment](../supported-build-environment).

## Cost Distribution

The base offering of the fully managed environment is an AWS sub account
which you own. We charge for the management of the environment no matter
how large your load grows.

Please contact sales@meroton.com for any inquiries.
