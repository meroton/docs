# Self-Hosted Remote Execution and Caching Environment

[‚Üê Other services](..)

For use cases where you would rather own and manage your own server cluster Meroton is available to help you set it up. Common reasons to want to run the environment locally is that it is dependent on custom hardware or specially licensed executors.

Meroton will help you set up the remote execution and caching environment [Buildbarn](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-deployments) and offer software maintenance keeping the system running smoothly.

If a self hosted solution doesn't feel like a good fit for you, perhaps you would rather have a [fully hosted cloud solution](../cloud-environment).
