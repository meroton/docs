# Working at Meroton

Meroton is growing and we're always on the lookout for people who can
contribute. At Meroton we work holistically with everything that is
required to make development efficient. That means that what we do is
not limited to a specific language or technology, rather around any
subject that allows findings solutions to large scale development
problems.

That said, to get some insight into what we work with, having experience
in this suite of technologies is helpful.

- [git](https://git-scm.com/about/branching-and-merging)
- [bazel](https://bazel.build/)
- [buildbarn](https://github.com/buildbarn)
- [go](https://go.dev/)
- [rust](https://rust-lang.org/)
- [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [react](https://react.dev/)
- [zuul](https://zuul-ci.org/)

Knowledge about compilers and packaging are also a large plus.
